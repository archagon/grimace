# Technical Notes

## Quarantine Flag

Using default project settings, directories modified using the app have the `com.apple.quarantine` flag set.
When examining URL resource values under `quarantinePropertiesKey`, the quarantine type is listed as `LSQuarantineTypeSandboxed`. 
I believe this is due to some sort of app sandboxing + drag & drop interaction.
Setting the `LSFileQuarantineEnabled` flag manually in Info.plist does not fix the issue.
Ultimately, the only solution I could find was to turn off app sandboxing. Oh well.
