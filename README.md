In macOS Tahoe, you can now customize directories to display an arbitrary SF Symbol or text string: <https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/07/11/macos-tahoes-folder-icon-customization>

This utility app makes it a little more convenient to perform this customization. No need to fiddle with `xattr` in the Terminal!

For a list of private SF Symbols you can use, Quentin Fasquel built a really nice viewer: <https://medium.com/@quentinfasquel/exploring-private-sf-symbols-8b0d064e9032>

Enjoy!
